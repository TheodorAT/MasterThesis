# This instance list represents the union of the instances listed on Hans
# Mittelmann's linear programming benchmark sites:
# - http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/lpsimp.html
# - http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/lpbar.html
# - http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/network.html
#
# The set of instances included in Mittelmann's benchmarks is updated
# periodically to stay relevant. This list was retrieved on approximately
# 2021-04-23. An approximate version of those pages on that date can be
# retrieved from archive.org:

# Note that archive.org skips the version of lpbar.html used when creating this
# list; the link is to the preceeding version. The differences are that brazil3,
# dbic1, neos1, neos2, ns1644855, nug15, pds-40, stat96v4, and watson_2 had been
# dropped, and set-cover had been added.
#
## We only select the faster ones, for smaller testing and modeling:

# neos3 # This one causes dwifob to crash, gives negative root argument... Debug in the future.
